START FUNCTION
1. Input an array `arr` of size `n`.
2. REPEAT steps 3–6 for `i = 0` to `n-2`:
    3. Set `swapped` to False.
    4. REPEAT for `j = 0` to `n-i-2`:
        a. IF `arr[j] > arr[j+1]`:
            i. SWAP `arr[j]` and `arr[j+1]`.
            ii. Set `swapped` to True.
    5. IF `swapped` is False:
        a. EXIT the loop (array is sorted).
6. END loop.
7. Output the sorted array.
END FUNCTION

arr = [11, 5, 5, 4, 7, 8, -1]



Outer loop
𝑖=0 Compare and swap adjacent elements:

Compare 11 and 5: Swap → [5, 11, 5, 4, 7, 8, -1]
Compare 11 and 5: Swap → [5, 5, 11, 4, 7, 8, -1]
Compare 11 and 4: Swap → [5, 5, 4, 11, 7, 8, -1]
Compare 11 and 7: Swap → [5, 5, 4, 7, 11, 8, -1]
Compare 11 and 8: Swap → [5, 5, 4, 7, 8, 11, -1]
Compare 11 and -1: Swap → [5, 5, 4, 7, 8, -1, 11]

Result after Pass 1: [5, 5, 4, 7, 8, -1, 11]


Now i=1. 11 at its positions:

Compare 5 and 5: No swap → [5, 5, 4, 7, 8, -1, 11]
Compare 5 and 4: Swap → [5, 4, 5, 7, 8, -1, 11]
Compare 5 and 7: No swap → [5, 4, 5, 7, 8, -1, 11]
Compare 7 and 8: No swap → [5, 4, 5, 7, 8, -1, 11]
Compare 8 and -1: Swap → [5, 4, 5, 7, -1, 8, 11]
Result after Pass 2: [5, 4, 5, 7, -1, 8, 11]


i=2. 8,11 at its positions:

Compare 5 and 4: Swap → [4, 5, 5, 7, -1, 8, 11]
Compare 5 and 5: No swap → [4, 5, 5, 7, -1, 8, 11]
Compare 5 and 7: No swap → [4, 5, 5, 7, -1, 8, 11]
Compare 7 and -1: Swap → [4, 5, 5, -1, 7, 8, 11]
Result after Pass 3: [4, 5, 5, -1, 7, 8, 11]

i=3. 7,8,11 at its positions:

Compare 4 and 5: No swap → [4, 5, 5, -1, 7, 8, 11]
Compare 5 and 5: No swap → [4, 5, 5, -1, 7, 8, 11]
Compare 5 and -1: Swap → [4, 5, -1, 5, 7, 8, 11]


i=4. 5,7,8,11 at its positions:

Compare 4 and 5: No swap → [4, 5, -1, 5, 7, 8, 11]
Compare 5 and -1: Swap → [4, -1, 5, 5, 7, 8, 11]
Result after Pass 5: [4, -1, 5, 5, 7, 8, 11]

i=5. 5,5,7,8,11  are in their correct positions:
Compare 4 and -1: Swap → [-1, 4, 5, 5, 7, 8, 11]

Final:[-1, 4, 5, 5, 7, 8, 11]
